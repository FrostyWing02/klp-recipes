        <h1>Mac 'n' Cheese</h1>

        <p>
            What's better than pasta coated in a creamy, silky, cheesy sauce?<br>
            There's a reason why mac and cheese is beloved by children and adults alike.<br>
            And while I could continue to wax poetic about everything that makes mac and cheese so incredible,<br>
            I'll tell you what stops me from making mac and cheese more often—a roux.

            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>1 pound elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>4 ounces cream cheese, cubed and at room temperature </li>

                <h3>Prepare the toping (optional):</h3>
                <p>
                    Melt the butter in a 10-inch Dutch oven or other heavy, deep pot over medium heat. <br>
                    Add the crushed crackers, black pepper, and kosher salt and stir to coat with the melted butter.<br> 
                    Continue to toast over medium heat, stirring often, until golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. 
                </p>

                <h3>Begin preparing the mac and cheese: </h3>
                <p>
                    In the same pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the ground mustard,<br>
                    pepper, and cayenne (if using). Stir to combine with the butter and lightly toast until fragrant, 15 to 30 seconds.<br>
                    Take care to not let the spices or butter begin to brown. Add the water, half and half, and kosher salt to the butter<br>
                    mixture and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat, uncovered.

                <h3>Cook the pasta: </h3>
                <p>
                    Once boiling, stir in the elbow macaroni, adjusting the heat as needed to maintain a rolling boil (but not boil over).<br> 
                    Continue to cook uncovered, stirring every minute or so, until the pasta is tender and the liquid is reduced enough to <br>
                    reveal the top layer of elbows, 6 to 9 minutes. The liquid mixture should just be visible around the edges of the pot,<br>
                    but still with enough to pool when you drag a spatula through the pasta. Remove from the heat.

                <p> 
                    Add the cream cheese to the pasta mixture and stir<br>
                    until almost completely melted. Add the shredded cheddar and<br>
                    Monterey Jack and stir until the cheeses are completely<br>
                    melted and saucy.

                <h3>Season and serve:</h3>
                <p>
                    Taste the mac and cheese. Season with more salt and pepper as needed.<br>
                    Serve immediately topped with the toasted Ritz topping, if using. Leftover mac and cheese<br>
                    can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
