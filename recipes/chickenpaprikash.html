        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Salt the chicken</h3>
                <p>Sprinkle the chicken well with salt and set aside at room temperature.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Slice the onions:</h3>
                <p>Slice the onions lengthwise (top to root).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Brown the chicken pieces:</h3>
                <p>
                    Heat a large sauté pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter. When the butter is hot,<br>
                    pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels and place them skin-side down in the pan.

                <h3>Sauté the onions:</h3>
                <p>
                    Add the sliced onions to the sauté pan and cook them,<br>
                    stirring occasionally,scraping up the browned bits from the chicken,<br>
                    until lightly browned, about 7 minutes.

                <h3>Add the paprika and black pepper:</h3>
                <p>
                    Add the paprika and black pepper to the onions and stir to combine.<br> Let cook for a minute.

                <h3>Add the chicken broth, place chicken on onions, cover and cook:</h3>
                <p>
                    Add the chicken broth, again scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan,<br> 
                    and then nestle the chicken pieces into the pan, on top of the onions.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cover and cook on a low simmer for 20 to 25 minutes (depending on the size of your chicken pieces).<br>
                    When the chicken is cooked through to 165°F, (use a digital thermometer) remove the pan from the heat.<br>
                    (If you want, you can also keep cooking the chicken until it begins to fall off the bone,<br>
                    which may take another 30 minutes or so.)
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Remove the chicken, stir in sour cream:</h3>
                <p>
                    When the chicken is done to your taste, remove the chicken from the pan.<br>
                    Allow the pan to cool for a minute and then slowly stir in the sour cream and add salt to taste.<br>
                    If the sour cream cools the sauce too much, turn the heat back on just enough to warm it through.<br>
                    Add the chicken back to the pan and coat with the sauce.
