        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Shepherd's pie comes to us from England, <br>
            and is traditionally made with lamb or mutton. <br>
            Here in the states we are more of a beef eating culture than a lamb eating one, <br>
            and when one is served "shepherd's pie" here, 
            it is most often made with ground beef.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste</li>
            <li>3 large (1 1/2 to 2 pounds) potatoes , peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>8 tablespoons (1 stick) butter, divided</li>
            <Li>1 medium onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)</Li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups mixed vegetables, such as diced carrots, corn, or peas</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds ground round beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/homemade-worcestershire-sauce-recipe-7109028" target="_blank">Worcestershire sauce</a>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Boil the potatoes</h3>
                <p>
                    Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. 
                    Cover with at least an inch of cold water.<br>
                    Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, 
                    and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Preheat the oven to 400°F.</h3>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Sauté the vegetables:</h3>
                <p>
                    While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat.<br>
                    Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.If you are including vegetables, <br>
                    add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, <br>
                    because they take as long to cook as the onions do. If you are including peas or corn, <br>
                    add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.
                </p>
